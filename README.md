Currently there are 22 built-in log profiles:

- Android Log Files.
- Android Kernel Log Files.
- Android System Trace File.
- Git Log.
- Git Log (Simple).

- Windows Event Logs (Application/System/Secutiry/Setup).

You can also create, copy or export your own log profiles according to your requirement.

## ‚≠ê Log filtering
Log filtering is the most important feature in ULogViewer which helps you to find and analyze the problem from logs.
You can filter logs by:
- Text filter described by regular expression.
- Level(Priority) of log.
- Process ID of log if available.
- Thread ID of log if available.

For text filter, you can also predefine some filters you may use frequently and filter logs by cobination of these text filters.

## ‚≠ê Log marking
When viewing logs, you can mark some logs with different colors which are important for you. There is a separated side panel to list all marked logs to help you to jump to marked log quickly.
Marked logs will be kept if you are viewing logs from files so that you don't need to mark them again when you open log files next time.
